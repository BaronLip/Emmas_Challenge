#### ABOUT:
This was a coding challenge shared with me from Emma, a fellow cohort student. I decided to take the challenge on for practice. 

#### STEPS:
- ~~Add cancel functionality to editModal.~~
- ~~Add edit functionality to editModal.~~
- How would you refresh the DOM after data is saved?
- Break out code into modules.
- Complete CSS so it's not completely janky.

#### LEARNINGS:
- Structuring nested objects.
- Using dot notation to utilize object data.
- CSS insertBefore.
- Arrow functions and returns still.
- Closures??? (Wasn't )
- Controlled form & setting data attributes.
- CSS ```size``` for select html elements to limit amount of visible options. Although it is not the right solution.
- Browser limitations. Using style attribute of ```max-height``` for the select html element works in Firefox but not Chrome.
- 

#### NOTE:
The edit link with each of the daily price should not be there. You would never personally edit a closing price of a stock.
