#### ABOUT:
This was a coding challenge shared with me from Emma, a fellow cohort student. I decided to take the challenge on for practice.

#### STEPS:
- Add cancel functionality to editModal.
- Break out code into modules.
- Complete CSS so it's not completely janky.

#### LEARNINGS:
- CSS insertBefore.
- Arrow functions and returns still.
- Closures???

#### NOTE:
The edit link with each of the daily price should not be there. You would never personally edit a closing price of a stock.
