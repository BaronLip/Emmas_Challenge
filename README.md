#### ABOUT:
This was a coding challenge shared with me from Emma, a fellow cohort student. I decided to take the challenge on for practice. 

#### DEPENDANCIES:
- This project was created using vanilla JS and the Live Server extension for VSCode.


#### HALF DOCUMENTED STEPS:
- ~~Add cancel functionality to editModal.~~
- ~~Add edit functionality to editModal.~~
- ~~How would you refresh the DOM after security data is saved?~~ (No need, just add a new dom element based on added data.)
- ~~Complete CSS so it's not completely janky.~~ (Not perfect but getting by for now.)
- ~~Add the 'Add' functionality.~~

#### LEARNINGS:
- Structuring nested objects.
- Using dot notation to utilize object data.
- CSS insertBefore.
- Arrow functions and returns still.
- Closures??? (Wasn't )
- Controlled form & setting data attributes.
- CSS ```size``` for select html elements to limit amount of visible options. Although it is not the right solution.
- Browser limitations. Using style attribute of ```max-height``` for the select html element works in Firefox but not Chrome.
- CSS grid for the editModal.
- JS insertBefore() is very clunky.

#### NOTE:
- The instructions for this code challenge are 100% terrible, see the word doc. The edit link within the "Prices" modal has no functionality.
- "Part 2. Design" is a separate project all together.
